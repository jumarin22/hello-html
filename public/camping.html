    <h2>An Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      I met someone who had previously planned a camping trip with two friends,
      but the friends backed out. The person seemed to not enjoy the idea of
      camping alone, so I asked if they wanted any company. They agreed and we
      eventually made our way to
      <a
        href="https://www.floridastateparks.org/parks-and-trails/hontoon-island-state-park"
        >Hontoon Stake Park</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      When making the reservation, we were not informed that the campground is
      practically an island, located between two rivers. The island is
      accessible only by watercraft, and so the park provided a ferry service.
      Luckily, on the morning of the departure date, a representative called us
      to confirm our reservation. They gave a courtesy reminder that the last
      ferry would leave at 6pm. Our reservation was on a Friday and we were both
      scheduled to work until 5pm. The park was 4 hours away.
