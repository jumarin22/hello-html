    <p>
      I met someone who had previously planned a camping trip with two friends,
      but the friends backed out. They seemed to not enjoy the idea of having to
      make camp trip alone, so I asked if they wanted any company. They agreed
      and we eventually made our way to
      <a
        href="https://www.floridastateparks.org/parks-and-trails/hontoon-island-state-park"
        >Hontoon Stake Park</a
      >.
    </p>

      When making the reservation, we were not made aware that the campground is
      practically an island, located between two rivers. The island is
      accessible only by watercraft, and so the park provided a ferry service.
      Luckily on the morning of the departure date, a representative called us
      to confirm our reservation, and gave a courtesy reminder that the last
      ferry leaves at 6pm. Our reservation was on a Friday, and we were both
      scheduled to work until 5pm. The park was 4 hours away.
