    <h1 class="hello-world">Chess Blog: An Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      Two jobs ago I worked with a client who was born and raised in a different
      country. I don't remember which country they were from, but I'm pretty
      sure it was either Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, or Uzbekistan. They were going
      to visit home soon and wanted to be prepared for a familial tradition:<em
        ><strong> playing chess against their brother</strong></em
      >. They asked me to play with them a few times before they left, and I
      agreed. We both downloaded the
      <a href="https://www.chess.com/">chess.com</a> app and played a few games.
      Eventually I also purchased and provided a chess board for our office's
      front area where groups of clients frequently worked, socialized, and ate.
      The clients were all international, and it was interesting to see the game
      of chess providing a common thread between them.

      Recently I was gifted a portable chess set. I like to bring it on my
      <a href="camping.html">camping trips</a>.
